# CryoEM_particle
This repository contains scripts used to crawl, download, process and annotate CryoEM protein particle data with ground truth annotations.

‘Cryo-PDS’ is a diverse, open-access, high-resolution Cryo-Electron Microscopy protein dataset for single particle analysis with benchmarking ground truth annotations. It consists of 335 different protein particles metadata and 31 different ground truth data. The metadata consists of 1,698,802 high resolution (<4 A) micrographs deposited in Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive (EMPIAR) with its corresponding FPT and Globus data download links. Moreover, 31 ground truth data consist of diversified 8789 Micrographs (~300 Cryo-EM images per EMPIAR ID) with manually curated ground truth coordinate of picked protein particles. We believe that the Cryo-PDS would bridge the gap between the computational potential of Deep Learning and the standard benchmarking dataset inadequacy for high-end microscopic analysis of Cryo-EM micrographs in academic research.
